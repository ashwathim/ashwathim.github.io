# We do not write in a vacuum 

Writing, by itself, is an active, political and a conscious act of indulging in the process of expression.

Virginia Woolf, not unlike other writers/artists, was highly influenced by her contemporary art, politics etc. especially that which the members of the Bloomsbury group engaged in among themselves.

Each of the members of the group have had their fair share of influence on Woolf. One of the major influences on her writings both -fiction and non-fiction, was the Post-Impressionist, painter, Bloomsbury member and friend- Roger Fry. 

She used devices like shift of perspectives, colors, shades, angles, the vastness of the outside against the narrowness of the inside to encapsulate visual aspect of her writing.
